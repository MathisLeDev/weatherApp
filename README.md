# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App !

## Getting Started

## Running the App

Once you are ready, you can run the app with `npm install` and that's it ! You should see the application [here](http://localhost:3000)

Currently, the generated apk doesn't seems to work on virtual and physical devices. I have no idea how to resolve this problem.
But it's still available on desktop with visual studio code and in debug option though.


PS: in case you want to build another APK. Here's the command:

    flutter build apk --release

Thank you for using my App!
